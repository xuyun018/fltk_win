/**
  The Fl_Multi_Browser class is a subclass of Fl_Browser
  which lets the user select any set of the lines.

  The user interface is Macintosh style: clicking an item turns off all the others and
  selects that one, dragging selects all the items the mouse moves over,
  and ctrl + click (Cmd+click on the Mac OS platform) toggles the items.
  Shift + click extends the selection until the clicked item.
  This is different from how forms did it.
  Normally the callback is done when the user releases the
  mouse, but you can change this with when().
  <P>See Fl_Browser for methods to add and remove lines from the browser.
