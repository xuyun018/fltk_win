/**
 A drawing surface that's susceptible to receive graphical output.
 Any FLTK application has at any time a current drawing surface to which all drawing requests are directed.
 The current surface is given by Fl_Surface_Device::surface().
 When main() begins running, the current drawing surface has been set to the computer's display,
 an instance of the Fl_Display_Device class.

 A drawing surface other than the computer's display, is typically used as follows:
 <ol><li> Create \c surface, an object from a particular Fl_Surface_Device derived class (e.g., Fl_Copy_Surface, Fl_Printer).
 <li> Call \c Fl_Surface_Device::push_current(surface); to redirect all graphics requests to
 \c surface which becomes the new current drawing surface (not necessary with classes Fl_Printer / Fl_PostScript_File_Device
 because it is done by Fl_Paged_Device::begin_page()).
 <li> At this point all of the \ref fl_drawings (e.g., fl_rect()) or the \ref fl_attributes or \ref drawing_images functions
 (e.g., fl_draw_image(), Fl_Image::draw()) operate on the new current drawing surface.
 Drawing surfaces from Fl_Widget_Surface derived classes allow additional ways
 to draw to them (e.g., Fl_Printer::print_widget(), Fl_Image_Surface::draw()).
 <li> After all drawing requests have been performed, redirect graphics requests back to their previous destination
 with \c Fl_Surface_Device::pop_current(); (not necessary with classes Fl_Printer / Fl_PostScript_File_Device).
 <li> Delete \c surface.
 </ol>
 For back-compatibility, it is also possible to use the Fl_Surface_Device::set_current() member function
 to change the current drawing surface, once to the new surface, once to the previous one.
