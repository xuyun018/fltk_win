/**
  This widget is a subclass of Fl_Output that displays multiple
  lines of text. It also displays tab characters as whitespace to the
  next column.

  Note that this widget does not support scrollbars, or per-character
  color control.

  If you are presenting large amounts of read-only text
  and need scrollbars, or full color control of characters,
  then use Fl_Text_Display. If you want to display HTML text,
  use Fl_Help_View.

  A caret cursor (^) shows the keyboard navigation mark
  for keyboard selection of the output text, e.g. Arrow Keys
  to move the cursor, Shift + Arrow Keys to create a text
  selection, and '^C' to copy the selected text to the paste buffer.
  The caret cursor can be disabled by disabling the widget's
  "visible focus" using clear_visible_focus(), inherited from the
  Fl_Widget base class. Doing this also disables the widget's
  keyboard navigation.
