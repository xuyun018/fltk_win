  As long as the mouse button is held down the item
  pointed to by it is highlighted, and this highlighting remains on when
  the mouse button is released. Normally the callback is done when the
  user releases the mouse, but you can change this with when().
  <P>See Fl_Browser for methods to add and remove lines from the browser.
