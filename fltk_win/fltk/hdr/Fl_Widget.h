      Override this function to draw your own widgets.

      If you ever need to call another widget's draw method <I>from within your
      own draw() method</I>, e.g. for an embedded scrollbar, you can do it
      (because draw() is virtual) like this:

      \code
        Fl_Widget *s = &scrollbar; // scrollbar is an embedded Fl_Scrollbar

      it when the user interacts with the widget.

      When implemented in a widget, this function must return 0 if the
      widget does not use the event or 1 otherwise.

      Most of the time, you want to call the inherited handle() method in
      your overridden method so that you don't short-circuit events that you
      don't handle. In this last case you should return the callee retval.

      One exception to the rule in the previous paragraph is if you really
      want to \e override the behavior of the base class. This requires
      knowledge of the details of the inherited class.

      In rare cases you may want to return 1 from your handle() method
      although you don't really handle the event. The effect would be to
      \e filter event processing, for instance if you want to dismiss
      non-numeric characters (keypresses) in a numeric input widget. You
      may "ring the bell" or show another visual indication or drop the
      event silently. In such a case you must not call the handle() method
      of the base class and tell FLTK that you \e consumed the event by
      returning 1 even if you didn't \e do anything with it.

      \param[in] event the kind of event received
      \retval 0 if the event was not used or understood

     \li FL_WHEN_RELEASE: The callback will be done when this widget loses
         the focus, including when the window is unmapped. This is a useful

     \li FL_WHEN_ENTER_KEY: If the user types the Enter key, the entire
         text is selected, and the callback is done if the text has changed.
         Normally the Enter key will navigate to the next field (or insert
         a newline for a Fl_Multiline_Input) - this changes the behavior.
     \li FL_WHEN_ENTER_KEY|FL_WHEN_NOT_CHANGED: The Enter key will do the
